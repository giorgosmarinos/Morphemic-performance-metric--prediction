# Performance Model
A task under the [Morphemic project](https://www.morphemic.cloud/).

This is an experimental repository in which we try to predict the performance of a service. Our model expects as input some configuration variables and provides as output an estimated performance. Our model is trained on history data that contains the configuration variables for a service and the current real resource allocation in course of time.
