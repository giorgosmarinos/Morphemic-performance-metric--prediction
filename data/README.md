## Directory *data/*

It's a tidy place where we maintain our datasets, as simple & clear as possible, in order to be clear for all what to use for their experiments. Descriptive titles will be extremely helpful.

### For the secure document dataset ###

Metrics: time,AvgResponseTime,nrOfInstances,AvgMemory,AvgCPU,numebrOfRequest,Latency
Variables: nrOfInstances (the name of the file contains the cpu variable and memory variable)
those values should added in the dataset as column.

This dataset has a very low quality, it is a good opportunity to apply some data imputation technics
