## Directory *experimentation/*

It's our playground where we can experiment with ML techonologies and techniques. The right place for our research efforts. It tends to be a messy procedure so we must follow some common rules/structure in order to limit the mess.
Here we will develop and test some of our novel ideas and solutions before we refactor and include some of them in the *ml_code/* directory.   

### Structure, Rules & Comments

Structure: 

* *code/* - Here we push our notebooks, python or r scripts. We should keep descriptive titles.	 
* *visualizations/* - Here we push our visualizations under the proper sub-directory with proper notes in a README.

Rules & Comments:

* We store datasets in the *data/* derictory of this repository.
* We try to use clear and discriptive titles and notes. Furthermore, we try to use clean code principles, a nice reference follows: [Clean Code concepts adapted for machine learning and data science](https://github.com/davified/clean-code-ml)
